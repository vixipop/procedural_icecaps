#‚ú®Procedural Icecaps‚ú®
This was my first-second time using shaders to play around and the idea of Procedurally generated stuff in Games is quite intriguing to me. 
I followed Bruno Simon's ThreeJS Journey and he made the math quite easy to follow in the tutorials.

##Further Improvements
The project was quite smooth giving good FPS, until I added a Mesh Physical material, which increased the Cost ALOT and my FPS dipped to 5-10. 
But the glacial effect it gives is too good and I'd rather find a cost- efficient way to fix that , than removing it entirely.
So trying to code a shader that gives a glassy effect OR using a different material will be next in my to-do.

I hope you like my project üê≥!!!!
